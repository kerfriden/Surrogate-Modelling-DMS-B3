These are a collection of notebooks that accompany a master-level course at Ecole des Mines de Paris on surrogate modelling.

Content :
- surrogate modelling for parametrised partial differential equations : sparse polynomial regression, Gaussian process regression, sparse grids
- physics-informed neural networks and their use for meta-modelling

  The lecture notes are also included in the repository
